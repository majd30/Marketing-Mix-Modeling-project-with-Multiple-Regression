Multiple regression analysis is employed in the Marketing Mix Modeling project to evaluate the impact of different media and marketing channels, such as TV, radio, and newspaper ad budgets, on Company X's sales performance. The model attempts to give insights into how well each channel drives sales by looking at the interactions between these variables. This will allow decision-makers to make well-informed choices about how best to allocate marketing money and tactics.
